# TrustWise TakeHome Assignment

## How to Run

### Docker Setup:
1. Ensure **Docker** is installed and running on your machine.
2. To check run "docker --version"
3. Clone this repository, open the terminal in that folder

### Building and Running the Services:
1. Run the following command in the root directory of the project to build and start the containers:

   ```bash
   docker network create my_app_network
   docker-compose up --build

Sometimes the build interrupts due to timeout or docker issues, please retry the above command of docker compose again.

Open http://localhost on any browser

## Time to Run
Since the Docker build process will install dependencies such as **torch**, **maven**, **jdk**, **flask**, and several other frameworks, the Docker build can take around **30 minutes** to complete, assuming a decent internet connection.

## Project Structure

This assignment is organized into three distinct folders:

- **Frontend**
- **Backend**
- **Flask Application**

---

## Frontend

The **Frontend** is built using the following technologies:

- **React.js**
- **Node.js**
- **JavaScript**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**

### Features:
- **User Interaction**: Displays an input box for user interaction.
- **Logs History**: Logs history is displayed in a table format.
- **Graph Visualization**: A graph visualizes the scored values generated by two different models.

### Communication:
- The frontend communicates with the **Backend** via **CORS** to facilitate API usage effectively.

---

## Backend

The **Backend** is a **Maven-based** application built with **Java JDK 22**.

### Project Structure:
Designed following industry-standard practices, it incorporates multiple layers, such as:
- **Beans**
- **Business**
- **DAO** (Data Access Object)
- **Controller**
- **Helper**
- **Utils**
- **Resources**

### Framework:
- Developed using the **Dropwizard** framework, which is a lightweight Java framework for building RESTful web services.

### Models:
- **Emotion Model**: Implemented using the **Inference API** (serverless) to handle emotion-related predictions.
- **Education Model**: Communicates with the **Flask Application** via a **cURL** call to retrieve results.

### Deployment:
- The backend runs on **localhost:8080**.

---

## Flask Application

The **Flask Application** is responsible for running the **Education Model**.

### Implementation:
- The application uses a **Hugging Face** model to perform education-related predictions.
- The model is hosted within **Flask**, which serves as the interface for this specific functionality.

### Deployment:
- The Flask application runs on **localhost:5000**.

---

## Notes
- All components (**Frontend**, **Backend**, and **Flask Application**) are individually **dockerized** using Docker.
- The deployment structure ensures **modularity**, allowing each service to operate independently while communicating seamlessly.
